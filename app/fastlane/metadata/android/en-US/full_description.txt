This is a authentication plugin for Hashicorp Vault.

The idea of this plugin is to add a manual human step into the authentication process. This works by registering the app with the vault and every time the vault tries to authenticate via this service. The service makes a push notification via firebase. The user can accept the authentication or deny it.
